# HiPy Web App Project

HiPy needs a website to post all it's resources and to promote itself. This is a great opportunity to demonstrate to you the awesome power of Python when used in conjunction with the web framework Django.

The website has already been deployed but you can start contributing to its functionality and design today by forking this repository.

Soon we'l set up a HiPy Website working group where we can discuss what we need for the site. In the meantime, if you're serious about learning becoming a contributor then checkout the resources that are currently posted on the site.
